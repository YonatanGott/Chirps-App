# This is a Chirps App
It's like tweets but better.


## The difference between chirp and tweet

Chirp implies the short, sharp, and thin sound that is made by practically all small birds and some insects; it regularly connotes cheerfulness but often also busyness and immaturity.
And Tweet usually implies the monosyllabic note of a very small bird or the call of small game birds (as the quail or bobwhite).
